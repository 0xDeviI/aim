# All ideas matter
This tool is a google chrome extension that removes Ukrine support banner from Github. Thomas Dohmke said [here](https://Github.blog/2022-03-02-our-response-to-the-war-in-ukraine/), Github supports Ukrine just like the global response, but it's wrong. Absolutly I am against war and I am worried for them, but the fact is you can't publicly support something on a website that millions of people are using it. You don't know response of everybody about it. If you want to support Ukrine, it's your own opinion, show and share your support in social media as your own identity, but you can't speak from everyone's side and if you are persisting about it, I don't think that Github is open to **Everybody** and this means Github is just agrees **people with the specific opinions**. By the way, i made it, and if you are against this Github action, simply install the extension and remove banner â›”.

### Installation
First of all clone the repo using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xDeviI/aim.git
```
Open google chrome, on the top-right section click on 3-dots, then click on settings. After that from the left side select `Extensions`. Then in the opened page enable or check `Developer mode`. Finally click on `Load unpacked` and select AIM cloned directory. After installation, whenever you navigate to your github dashboard, the banner should be deleted automatically.
