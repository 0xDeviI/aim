        <p class="text">This tool is a google chrome extension that removes Ukrine support banner from Github. Thomas Dohmke said <a href="https://Github.blog/2022-03-02-our-response-to-the-war-in-ukraine/">here</a>, Github supports Ukrine just like the global response,
            but it's wrong. Absolutly I am against war and I am worried for them, but the fact is you can't publicly support something on a website that millions of people are using it. You don't know response of everybody about it. If you want to support
            Ukrine, it's your own opinion, show and share your support in social media as your own identity, but you can't speak from everyone's side and if you are persisting about it, I don't think that Github is open to <b>Everybody</b> and this means
            Github is just agrees <b>people with the specific opinions</b>. By the way, i made it, and if you are against this Github action, simply install the extension and remove banner ‚õî.</p>
